The codes can be found in the 'codes' folder, while the 'Examples' folder contains GROMACS-PLUMED input files.

To install GROMACS and PLUMED please visit the official websites,
GROMACS: http://www.gromacs.org/
PLUMED: https://github.com/plumed/plumed2

To install PLUMED with CmuMD, copy NshellSp.cpp to the plumed2/src/colvar/

To use the RefCV, copy RefCV.cpp to the plumed2/src/multicolvar/
Reference for RefCV: https://github.com/PabloPiaggi/JCP-2019.git


(It is to be noted that, the current version is a development version. In order to improve the method, changes will be made in the future release of the code.)
